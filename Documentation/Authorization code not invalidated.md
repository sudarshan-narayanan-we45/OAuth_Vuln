# Stealing Users OAUTH Tokens via redirect_uri
> OAuth2 API makes it possible for users to grant access to their accounts with autorization server. When some user denies access for the application, all access_tokens are being revoked and become invalid. But not only access_tokens should be revoked, authorization codes (it is intermediate token used in OAuth2 Authorization Flow) must be revoked too. In this vulnerable application implementation does not revoke authorization code during access revocation. It may be exploited to restore access to user's account by malicious application after access revocation.

> Use the Burp to intercept the request 
  
#### Step 1:
